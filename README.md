## Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tempo": {
      "url": "https://YOUR-WORKER.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/sse?k=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

> The MCP endpoints are gated. The `?k=` param carries your `AUTH_TOKEN` (see Setup). Clients that support custom headers can send `Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>` instead of the query param.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Cloudflare account
2. Spotify Developer App (get client ID & secret from https://developer.spotify.com)

### First Time

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Configure wrangler.toml with your settings
4. Set secrets:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
   npx wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN   # your MCP endpoint key — any strong random string
   ```
   (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `HF_SPACE_URL` are plain `[vars]` in `wrangler.toml` — fill those in there.)
5. Deploy: `npm run deploy`
6. Visit `https://YOUR-WORKER.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/auth`
7. Authorize with Spotify
8. Done - tokens are stored in KV

### For Audio Analysis (Optional)

For deep audio analysis (BPM, mood, spectrogram), use [Synesthesia](https://github.com/amarisaster/Synesthesia) - the local companion MCP.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Local dev
npm run deploy   # Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run tail     # View logs
```
